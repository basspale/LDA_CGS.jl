In this work, we choose four\ntypical dark energy models as examples, i.e., the $\\Lambda$CDM model, the\n$w$CDM model, the $\\alpha$DE model, and the GCG model, to complete the\nanalysis. We find that, when only the current $H(z)$ data are added, the\nconstraints on these models are not improved compared to the cases using the\nSN+CMB+BAO data; but when further adding the 10-year SL test data, the\nconstraint results are tremendously improved for all the four models.\nTherefore, we conclude that, although the current $H(z)$ measurements could not\nprovide an evident improvement on the basis of the current mainstream\ncosmological probes, the future $H(z)$ measurements from the SL test would have\nenormous potential to change the status of the Hubble parameter measurements in\nconstraining dark energy."}, "authors": ["Yan Liu", "Rui-Yun Guo", "Jing-Fei Zhang", "Xin Zhang"], "author_detail": {"name": "Xin Zhang"}, "author": "Xin Zhang", "arxiv_comment": "9 pages, 2 figures", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12131v1", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12131v1", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "astro-ph.CO", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "astro-ph.CO", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "gr-qc", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "hep-ph", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12131v1", "affiliation": "None", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12131v1", "journal_reference": null, "doi": null}

The models under consideration have a rich\nphenomenology and can be experimentally probed in leptophilic $Z^\\prime$\nsearches, dark matter searches, heavy Majorana neutrino searches, as well as\nthrough hunting for new Higgs portal scalars in multi-lepton channels at\ncolliders."}, "authors": ["Marcela Carena", "Mariano Quir\u00f3s", "Yue Zhang"], "author_detail": {"name": "Yue Zhang"}, "author": "Yue Zhang", "arxiv_comment": "6 pages, 1 figure", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09719v1", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09719v1", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "hep-ph", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "hep-ph", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "astro-ph.CO", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "hep-ex", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09719v1", "affiliation": "None", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09719v1", "journal_reference": null, "doi": null}

First, we use the $O(4)$ Linear Sigma Model as a testbed\nto derive the connection between $\\chi_S$ and the $\\sigma$ propagator and to\ncheck the validity and reliability of the approach where $\\chi_S$ is saturated\nby the $\\sigma/f_0(500)$ inverse self-energy, which we calculate at finite $T$\nto one loop. A more accurate phenomenological description is achieved by\nconsidering the saturation approach as given by the thermal $f_0(500)$ state\ngenerated in Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory.

Our\nsimulation framework allows to quantify the impact of different reconstruction\nimprovements on the experimental performance. For example, we show that using\nthe particle identification information improves the energy resolution by a\nfactor of two. In future, the framework can be used to assess the impact of\ncross section uncertainties on the oscillation sensitivity."}, "authors": ["Alexander Friedland", "Shirley Weishi Li"], "author_detail": {"name": "Shirley Weishi Li"}, "author": "Shirley Weishi Li", "arxiv_comment": "21 pages, 18 figures", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06159v1", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06159v1", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "hep-ph", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "hep-ph", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "hep-ex", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "nucl-ex", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "nucl-th", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06159v1", "affiliation": "None", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06159v1", "journal_reference": null, "doi": null}

We\nrevise this model and explore two different scenarios for the renormalization\nscheme, that is, using a modified common energy scale to perform the\nsubtractions or utilizing a common ultraviolet cutoff to render finite the\nultraviolet divergent loop functions in all channels. In both cases, we show\nthat some (at least three) of the dynamically generated states can be\nidentified with the experimental $\\Omega_c$, while having odd parity and\n$J=1/2$ or $J=3/2$. Two of these states turn out to be part of the same ${\\rm\nSU(6)} \\times {\\rm HQSS}$ multiplets as the charmed and bottomed $\\Lambda$\nbaryons."}, "authors": ["Laura Tolos", "Rafael Pavao", "Juan Nieves"], "author_detail": {"name": "Juan Nieves"}, "author": "Juan Nieves", "arxiv_comment": "8 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure, contribution based on an invited\n  parallel talk to XIII Quark Confinement and the Hadron Spectrum -\n  Confinement2018, 31 July - 6 August 2018, Maynooth University, Ireland", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05149v1", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05149v1", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "hep-ph", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "hep-ph", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "hep-ex", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "nucl-th", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05149v1", "affiliation": "None", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05149v1", "journal_reference": null, "doi": null}

For $f$\nmuch above TeV, the ALP-induced electroweak phase transition is approximately\ndescribed by adiabatic processes, distinguishing our scenario for electroweak\nbaryogenesis from the conventional ones.

We include both radiative\ncorrections and the effect of non-renormalisable operators on this splitting.\nIn order to explore the full range of charged state lifetimes, we consider\nsignals including long-lived charged particles, disappearing tracks, and\nmonophotons. By combining the different searches we find discovery and\nexclusion contours in the mass-lifetime plane. In particular, when the mass\nsplitting is generated purely through radiative corrections, we can exclude the\npure-Higgsino doublet below 310 GeV, the pure-wino triplet below 775 GeV, and\nthe minimal dark matter fermion quintet below 1025 GeV. The scenario where the\nthermal relic abundance of a Higgsino accounts for the whole dark matter of the\nUniverse can be excluded if the mass splitting between the charged and neutral\nstates is less than 230 MeV. Finally, we discuss possible improvements to these\nlimits by using associated hard leptons to idenify the soft visible decay\nproducts of the charged members of the dark matter multiplet."}, "authors": ["Kenji Kadota", "Andrew Spray"], "author_detail": {"name": "Andrew Spray"}, "author": "Andrew Spray", "arxiv_comment": "24 pages, 14 figures; version 2, additional references", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00560v2", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00560v2", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "hep-ph", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "hep-ph", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00560v2", "affiliation": "None", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00560v2", "journal_reference": null, "doi": null}

We provide results in the helicity\ncoordinate system and in the Collins-Soper coordinate system, at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Our results show that the fiducial\npolarization fractions in the helicity coordinate system have similarities to\nthe physical fractions, while those in the Collins-Soper coordinate system do\nnot. The EW corrections are found to be important in two of the angular\ncoefficients related to the $Z$ boson, irrespective of the kinematical cuts or\nthe coordinate system.

Inspired by recent works, we elaborate further on the possibility of\nsignificant primordial tensor non-Gaussianities sourced by extra fields during\ninflation. Unitarity constraints limit the impact of extra (spinning) particle\ncontent by means of a lower bound on the corresponding mass spectrum. For\nspin-2 particles, this takes the form of the well-known Higuchi bound. Massive\n($m\\gtrsim H$) particles will typically decay during inflation unless they are\nnon-minimally coupled to the inflaton sector: the inflating field \"lifts\" the\ndynamics of the extra field(s), effectively getting around the limits imposed\nby unitarity. There exist several models that realize such a mechanism, but we\nfocus here on the set-up of [1] where, through an EFT approach, one is able to\ncapture the essential features common to an entire class of theories. In the\npresence of an extra massive spin-2 particle, the interactions in the tensor\nsector mimic very closely those in the scalar sector of quasi-single-field\ninflationary models.

Inspired by recent works, we elaborate further on the possibility of\nsignificant primordial tensor non-Gaussianities sourced by extra fields during\ninflation. Unitarity constraints limit the impact of extra (spinning) particle\ncontent by means of a lower bound on the corresponding mass spectrum. For\nspin-2 particles, this takes the form of the well-known Higuchi bound. Massive\n($m\\gtrsim H$) particles will typically decay during inflation unless they are\nnon-minimally coupled to the inflaton sector: the inflating field \"lifts\" the\ndynamics of the extra field(s), effectively getting around the limits imposed\nby unitarity. There exist several models that realize such a mechanism, but we\nfocus here on the set-up of [1] where, through an EFT approach, one is able to\ncapture the essential features common to an entire class of theories. In the\npresence of an extra massive spin-2 particle, the interactions in the tensor\nsector mimic very closely those in the scalar sector of quasi-single-field\ninflationary models.

We demonstrate that this could\nallow for resonant dark matter-neutron oscillations in the early universe, at\nfinite temperature, leading to low-scale baryogenesis starting from a\nprimordial dark matter asymmetry. In this scenario, the asymmetry transfer\nhappens around 30 MeV, just before big bang nucleosynthesis.
